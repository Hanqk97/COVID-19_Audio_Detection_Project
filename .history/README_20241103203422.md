# COVID-19 Audio Detection System Project

## Goal
Detect COVID-19 from audio data (breathing, cough, and speech) to classify subjects as COVID-positive or COVID-negative.

### 1. Data Preprocessing

1. **Segment Audio Files**
   - **Goal**: Standardize all audio files into 2-3 second segments.
   - **How**: Use `librosa` in Python (`librosa.effects.split`) to split each audio file.
   - **Outcome**: Creates multiple shorter clips from each audio recording.

2. **Denoise Audio**
   - **Goal**: Remove background noise for clearer signals.
   - **How**: Apply spectral gating or a band-pass filter using `scipy.signal`.
   - **Outcome**: Cleaner audio samples that enhance feature quality.

3. **Data Augmentation**
   - **Goal**: Balance dataset by increasing COVID-positive samples.
   - **How**:
     - **Pitch Shift**: Use `librosa.effects.pitch_shift` to vary pitch slightly.
     - **Time Stretch**: Use `librosa.effects.time_stretch` to alter speed.
     - **Noise Injection**: Add light noise to simulate natural variations.
   - **Outcome**: Augmented dataset with more diversity and balance.

### 2. Feature Extraction

1. **Extract Time-Domain Features**
   - **Features**: Zero-crossing rate, RMS energy, and signal energy.
   - **How**: Use `librosa.feature` functions like `librosa.feature.zero_crossing_rate`.
   - **Outcome**: Feature vectors summarizing time-based audio patterns.

2. **Extract Frequency-Domain Features**
   - **Features**: Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).
   - **How**: Use `librosa.feature.mfcc` to extract 13 MFCCs for each sample.
   - **Outcome**: Frequency-based features useful for capturing audio characteristics.

3. **Create Spectrograms**
   - **Goal**: Convert audio into visual spectrograms for CNN models.
   - **How**: Use `librosa.feature.melspectrogram` to create Mel spectrograms, then save as images if needed.
   - **Outcome**: Image-based representations of audio for deep learning.

### 3. Model Selection and Training

- **Goal**: Train various models (SVM, Random Forest, CNN, ResNet) on extracted features to classify COVID status from audio data.
- **Outcome**: Trained models ready for evaluation.

---

### 4. Model Evaluation

- **Goal**: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
- **Outcome**: Quantitative performance measures indicating model effectiveness.

---

### 5. Deployment

- **Goal**: Deploy the model for real-time COVID-19 detection through an API.
- **Outcome**: Accessible API that accepts audio files and returns COVID-19 detection results.

### Summary

This pipeline provides a structured approach to develop and deploy a COVID-19 detection system based on audio data. Each step is clearly outlined, making it straightforward to implement and document for future references.
